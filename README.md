# Introduction 
The Azure Key Vault and Managed HSM Engine allows OpenSSL-based applications to use RSA/EC private keys protected by Azure Key Vault and Managed HSM. It leverages the OpenSSL engine interface to perform cryptographic operations inside Azure Key Vault and Managed HSM. The goal is to seamlessly onboard OpenSSL-based applications with Azure Key Vault and Managed HSM, for example, NGINX, gRPC etc.

> NOTE: Azure Key Vault should ONLY be used for development purposes with small numbers of requests. For production workloads, use Azure Managed HSM. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault Service Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/service-limits)

# Getting Started

## Linux/Ubuntu

1. Install dependencies
   ```
    sudo apt install -y build-essential
    sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
    sudo apt install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev
    sudo apt install -y libjson-c-dev
   ```
2. Clone Repo
3. Build
   ```
    cd src
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1/
    sudo cp e_akv.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1/e_akv.so
   ```
4. Test
   ```
   openssl engine -vvv -t e_akv
   ```

## Windows

1. Install Visual Studio 2019
2. Install `vcpk` in command window "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019"
    ```
    c:
    cd \
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics
    vcpkg.exe install json-c:x64-windows-static
    vcpkg.exe install curl:x64-windows-static
    vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
    mkdir C:\vcpkg\packages\openssl_x64-windows\lib\engines-1_1
    ```
3. Clone Repo
4. Build 
   ```
   cd src
   msbuild e_akv.vcxproj /p:PkgCurl="C:\vcpkg\packages\curl_x64-windows-static" /p:PkgJson="C:\vcpkg\packages\json-c_x64-windows-static" /p:PkgZ="C:\vcpkg\packages\zlib_x64-windows-static" /p:PkgOpenssl="C:\vcpkg\packages\openssl_x64-windows" /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64
   copy /Y x64\Release\e_akv.dll C:\vcpkg\packages\openssl_x64-windows\lib\engines-1_1\e_akv.dll
   ```
5. Test 
   ```
   C:\vcpkg\packages\openssl_x64-windows\tools\openssl\openssl.exe engine -vvv -t e_akv
   ```
   
NOTE: new vcpkg is using openssl 3.0 and please use vcpkg.json to override openssl version
```
vcpkg.json
{ 
  "name": "dbkg", 
  "version-string": "1.0.0", 
  "dependencies": [ "zlib", "json-c", "curl", "abseil", "c-ares", "grpc", "protobuf", "re2", "upb", "openssl"],
  "builtin-baseline": "2ac61f87f69f0484b8044f95ab274038fbaf7bdd", 
  "overrides": [ 
     { "name": "openssl", "version-string": "1.1.1n" },
     { "name": "zlib", "version-string": "1.2.13" }
  ] 
} 

vcpkg\vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows-static
cd D:\AzureKeyVaultManagedHSMEngine\src
set VCPKG_ROOT=D:\vcpkg
msbuild  e_akv.vcxproj /p:PkgOpenssl="%VCPKG_ROOT%\packages\openssl_x64-windows" /p:PkgCurl="%VCPKG_ROOT%\packages\curl_x64-windows-static" /p:PkgJson="%VCPKG_ROOT%\packages\json-c_x64-windows-static" /p:PkgZ="%VCPKG_ROOT%\packages\zlib_x64-windows-static" /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64
```
